# ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL PROOF OF CONCEPT - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE ⚠️

**CRITICAL WARNING: This codebase is an experimental proof of concept and contains known security vulnerabilities. DO NOT deploy to mainnet or use with real funds.**

## Known Critical Issues
- **Security vulnerabilities** that could result in complete loss of funds
- **Missing access controls** and reentrancy protections
- **Unaudited smart contracts** with potential logic errors

**This code is intended for research purposes only. The smart contracts have not been audited and contain known vulnerabilities. Use only for testing purposes.**

# Overview

This project implements a smart contract for OTC Bilateral Trading of Uncleared FX Forwards with Delivery that removes counterparty credit risk and automates settlement processes. 
The system enables two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest rate payments based on a notional amount, with automatic margin calls and settlement through Chainlink oracles.

### Key Benefits

- **Trustless OTC Bilateral Trading**: No intermediaries required
- **Automated Settlement**: Daily margin calls and maturity settlement via Chainlink
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Identity verification and compliance checks
- **Risk Management**: Automatic collateral management and termination mechanisms
- **Audit**: Full on-chain audit trail

# Features

### Core Functionality
- **Trade Inception & Confirmation**: Secure trade initiation with matching validation
- **Automated Margin Calls**: Daily collateral adjustments based on rate movements
- **Settlement Automation**: Chainlink-powered settlement at maturity
- **Early Termination**: Mutual termination with agreed settlement amounts
- **Collateral Management**: Dynamic margin requirements and collateral posting

### Compliance & Security
- **Identity Verification**: ERC-3643 compatible identity registry integration
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with counterparty validation
- **Pausable Operations**: Emergency controls for risk management
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive event logging for all operations

### Risk Management

- **Pre-funded margin requirements**
- **Automatic termination on insufficient collateral**
- **Emergency pause functionality**
- **Multi-signature controls for critical operations**

### Token Standards
